# Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures
## freeCodeCamp Certificate Course
To be honest, javascript has been on the back-burner when it comes to my preferred programming language. I'm taking this course to not only to learn all the javascript ES6 features I've failed to learn over the last few years, but to fall in love again with my first ever programming language.

The goal is to complete this certificate program and apply what I've learned to my current career, AWS Architecture and Artificial Intelligence.
